        <!-- How It Works Section -->
        <section id="how-it-works">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Our blockchain-powered supply chain tracking system leverages distributed ledger technology to establish an unalterable record of transactions. By utilizing smart contracts, key processes like order placement, shipment tracking, and payment settlement are automated, ensuring a seamless flow of operations across the supply chain. Upon manufacturing a product, comprehensive details including its origin, production date, and batch number are meticulously logged onto the blockchain. As the product progresses through various stages of the supply chain, each transaction is meticulously recorded and timestamped, generating a comprehensive audit trail capturing every movement. This heightened level of transparency serves as a robust deterrent against fraudulent activities, minimizes the occurrence of errors, and fosters stronger trust and collaboration among all stakeholders involved.</p>
